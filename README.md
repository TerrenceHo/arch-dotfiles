# Arch Dotfiles

This is my collection of configuration files. The following is configured:

1. i3/i3status
2. nvim
3. X display server
4. git
5. zsh
6. pavucontrol

The goal is to eventually add all systemd configs here and have a script to
automatically set up the machine configuration in the case of a full wipe.
